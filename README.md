# SCALE BREAKERS SPACE

This repo contains the in-progress source code for the Scalebreakers site — a modular, style-locked creative platform built for speed, clarity, and scale.

⚠️ NOTE: This is not the final build. Two known issues are pending fixes. Expect updates soon.

## 🔧 Structure

- `client/` — Frontend UI (Vite + TSX)
- `server/` — Backend logic and API routes
- `shared/` — Shared types/constants
- `drizzle/` — SQL schema and migrations
- `patches/` — Dependency overrides

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
